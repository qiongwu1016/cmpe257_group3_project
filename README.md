## Project: Predict Future Sales

### Introduction

<p>
In this project we are working with a challenging time-series dataset that consists of monthly sales data provided by a Russian software firm (1C Company). We performed data cleaning, pre-processing, and feature engineering to extract the maximally important features from the existing dataset.
</p>
<p>
Implementation of various ML algorithms, including: <br />
- LightGBM <br />
- CatBoost <br />
- XGBoost <br />
- Neural Network <br />
- Naive Bayesian <br />
- LSTM <br />
</p>

### Dataset
- <p>The dataset consists of real world  historical sales data with the following datafields: </p>
- ID - an Id that represents a (Shop, Item) tuple within the test set <br />
- shop_id - unique identifier of a shop <br />
- item_id - unique identifier of a product <br />
- item_category_id - unique identifier of item category <br />
- item_cnt_day - number of products sold. You are predicting a monthly amount of this measure <br />
- item_price - current price of an item <br />
- date - date in format dd/mm/yyyy <br />
- date_block_num - a consecutive month number, used for convenience. January 2013 is 0, February 2013 is 1,..., October 2015 is 33 <br />
- item_name - name of item <br />
- shop_name - name of shop <br />
- item_category_name - name of item category <br />
